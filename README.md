# Geometry Modelling

This repository contains the work realised in Geometric Modeling class at the University of São Paulo during my double degree. 
We had some [homeworks](/homeworks) and a [final project](/finalProject). 

The objective of the project was to reproduce key results from the paper from [Macêdo, Gois and Velho](/finalProject/references/macedo-HRBFImplicits-CGF.pdf).

The final report is a htm file that can be previewed [here](http://htmlpreview.github.com/?https://github.com/theopinard/geometryModelling/blob/master/finalProject/presentation/Hermit_Radial_Basis_Function_Theodore_Meynard.htm) and
a presentation in portuguese can also be found [here](/finalProject/presentation/ModelagemGeometrica.pdf).
